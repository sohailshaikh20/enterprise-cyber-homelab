# Security Policy / Safe Use

This repository documents a **cybersecurity training lab** intended for **legal, isolated, educational use**.

## Rules of engagement
- Only run tests against systems you own and explicitly configured for this lab.
- Keep the lab isolated using **host-only/internal networks**.
- Do **not** expose vulnerable VMs to the internet.
- Use snapshots before running disruptive tests.
- Do not store real credentials, API keys, or personal data in this repo.

## Reporting concerns
If you notice something in this repo that could cause accidental exposure (e.g., bridged networking defaults, secrets in examples),
please open an issue labeled **security** and avoid posting real secrets.
