# GPO Baseline (training)

Suggested baseline controls for a training lab:
- Strong password policy
- Account lockout threshold (lab-appropriate)
- Enable advanced audit policy
- Enable PowerShell logging (Module + Script Block)
- Restrict where admin accounts can log in (jump host pattern)

Document what you changed + why (screenshots recommended).
