# Scenario 04 — Detection & Triage Workflow

## Objective
Turn an alert into a structured investigation and a short incident report.

## Workflow
1. Start from a single alert (auth burst, suspicious scripting, etc.)
2. Pivot on user, host, and time window
3. Decide: benign / suspicious / confirmed
4. Document: scope + containment + lessons learned

## Output
Write a 1–2 page report in `docs/` based on `docs/runbooks/incident-response.md`.
